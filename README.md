# Data Structures & Algorithms Course by NIIT

This course will enable a learner to select and implement an appropriate data structure and algorithm to solve a specific programming problem.

The Book is divided into eleven (11) chapters and aims to teach the;

- role of data structures and algorithms in problem solving through computers

- techniques to design algorithms and measure their efficiency

- sorting of data through the use of bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, shell sort, quick sort, and merge sort

- searching of data through the use of linear search and binary search techniwues

- storing and searching of data using hashing

- solving of programming problems using linked lists, stacks, queues, trees and graphs.

## Motivation

During my third year of college, I lived amongst mostly Computer Science students in my student accomodation off campus and naturally stumbled upon this textbook(Data Structures and Algorithms by NIIT) while scouring the store, cleaned it and kept it for later.

Having taken a few programming courses in prior school years and being a self-taught programmer myself, I understood the need for data strucutres and algorithms in solving problems efficiently using the computer as a tool.

## Why a need for yet another repository?

This repository contains solutions that I propose to the exercises contained in the book. They may not be the most efficient or the most pretty, but I at the very least guarantee that they would solve the problem.

The repository would be organised into the chapters of the book, like so;

- Chapter1
- Chapter2
- Chapter3 etc.

While the book teaches using the C#/C++ programming language, my solutions will be in TypeScript/JavaScript for the most part.
